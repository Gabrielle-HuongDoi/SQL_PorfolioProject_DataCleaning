# SQL_PorfolioProject_DataCleaning

This is my first SQL portfolio project.
In this project, we will create and import data from Excel file into MySQL server.

In addition, there are SQL skills involved from basic to advance such as UPDATE table, delete columns, 
TRIM white spaces, seperate SUBSTRING, JOINS, CTE's, subqueries, Window functions, Aggregate functions, DATE convert, etc.

The data provided is .xlsx file, we will have to convert it into .CSV file before uploading into SQL server.
