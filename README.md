### SQL PorfolioProject DataCleaning

This is my first SQL portfolio project.
In this project, we will clean raw data which has duplicates, wrong format of date as well as missing values.

In addition, there are SQL skills involved from basic to advance such as UPDATE table, delete columns, 
TRIM white spaces, seperate SUBSTRING, JOINS, CTE's, subqueries, Window functions, Aggregate functions, DATE convert, etc.

The data provided is .xlsx file, we will have to convert it into .CSV file before uploading into SQL server.
The data is Nashville housing information which include the parcel_ID, sale date, sale price, owner info registered.
It contains more than 55,000 rows and more or less 20 columns.
